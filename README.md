## About
Go Phish is a card memory game created to educate people about the ongoing threat of cybercrime, specifically Phishing while also letting them test their memory and have some fun. It consists of a 12 card deck with 6 pairs of 2 cards within. Each pair represents a form of phishing with a small logo designed to portray it. I hope you enjoy playing!

### design

- #### Colour Scheme
    - As a game, a contrasting color scheme was needed to portray a fun and enjoyable feeling. 
    The colours chosen were Strong Blue (#2980CC), Bright Red (#EE2A30) and White (#FFF).  
    <img src="./assets/images/readme/go-phish-colour-palette.png" height="100px"/>

- #### Typography
    - The font used for the title, logo, and headings is Bangers which is a cursive font. This font gives a very fun comic book/game feel and is perfect for the site.

        <img src="./assets/images/readme/bangers-font.png" height="30px" />

    - The font used for the paragraphs, game info, and navigation is Montserrat. It is part of the Sans-Serif family and is very legible while also informal enough to be used for a game. 

        <img src="./assets/images/readme/montserrat-font.png" height="30px" />


- #### Imagery
    - The logo was bought off <a href="https://www.vectorstock.com/royalty-free-vector/thief-hacking-a-computer-icon-cyber-attack-vector-21584120?refer=eml">Vector stock</a> and I made a few tweaks using Adobe Photoshop. 
    - The Cartoon fish used was downloaded off <a href="https://webstockreview.net/pict/getfirst">Web Stock Review</a> and all edits were made by me using Adobe Photoshop. 
- #### Wireframes/Mockups
    - The mockup images seen above and below were created using <a href="http://ami.responsivedesign.is/">Am I Responsive</a> and <a href="https://magicmockups.com/">Magic Mockups</a>. Wireframes were created using Adobe XD. Both mobile and desktop versions are linked below;

## Features

### Existing Features

#### Common Features Across All Pages
- **Header** - allows user to easily navigate across all pages
    - Navigation is included in the header to let the user intuitively locate it.
    - Navigation links change color when hovered over. This lets the visitor know that it is clickable.
    - The navigation link, matching the page that the user is visiting, changes color to let the user quickly establish which page she/he is visiting.
    - Navigation links collapse in a personalized hamburger menu when viewed in mobile/tablet sizes.
    - Colors have been chosen with optimum contrast in mind to be pleasant to the eye and legible.
- **Accessibility**
    - All images have a description in case the image link breaks as well as helping screen readers.
    - The hamburger menu has an aria-label added to let users with screen readers know where the toggleable menu is.
- **Buttons**
    - All buttons are styled in a similar way to provide consistency across the page. When hovering over a button, the text will similarly change color to the navigation bar to give the user a clear understanding that it is clickable.
- **Responsiveness**
    - All Pages are responsive and provide the same functionality regardless of the viewport size and device brand/orientation.


### Specific to Pages
- **Home & About**
    - Buttons to play all 4 game difficulties on top of the easy to use navigation bar make it incredibly obvious and simple to play the game. 
    - A small summary of what is phishing followed by a deck explaining the different types of phishing, featuring all 6 cards that players will see during the game. 
    - Each card in the deck is clickable and will bring the user to the section of which type of phishing they are looking at below. 
- **Play**
    - The game pages themself are kept simple to let the user focus on their progress and playing experience. 
    - There is a game-info section that contains the time remaining, flips, and level. 
    Below the game info is the game itself. 3 rows of 4 cards on desktop and tablet and 6 rows of 2 cards on mobile. 
- **How To Play**
    - A simple paragraph explaining the game and how a user can play it is all that is needed for the how-to-play page. Any user that clicks on How To Play knows exactly what they are looking for and what they should expect. 
- **Contact**
    - Another form using input fields to gather contact details of a user while categorizing which level they are querying and a small text box to receive their message. 
    - Google Maps was added with a funny/false location of a fish market in Denmark with the name "Go Fish".


### Future Features
- In the future, I would like to implement a leaderboard where users can proudly show their scores on a live leaderboard viewable to everyone. 
- I would also like to add a shuffle function after a certain amount of clicks.

### Fixed Bugs
- While building the game with help from a different tutorial, I encountered a few bugs with the shuffle function and cards flipping correctly so I decided to go a completely different method and changed my shuffle function to the Fisher-Yates algorithm. 
- Overlays were being made visible after anywhere on the game screen was clicked. order of code was incorrect and the "click to restart" function was showing overlays instead. All was fixed very simply. 
- The original cards used for the types of phishing images on the home page had a button which was supposed to open an accordion of information as well as bring the user down to that section, however, the content was too big for the accordion and also the text within the button was too small to read on mobile seen as I wanted to have minimum of 2 cards beside each other on mobile to reduce scrolling. The buttons were removed and the entire card is now clickable making it much easier for the user. 

### Ongoing Bugs
- A glitch has been noted on mobile when flipping cards. The card above the clicked card will glitch for a millisecond when clicking another card. It does not affect the game or show the user what is on the other side of the card apart from being slightly distracting. 
- Slight bit of horizontal overflow but only on screens less than 194px.

## Credits

### Code
- The game was created with help from 2 brilliant tutorials on YoutTube by [WebDevSimplified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28VfzEiJgy4) and [PortEXE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uuQ3g92oPQ&t=3028s). WebDev does the first part with HTML and CSS before handing it off to PortEXE for the Javascript. 
- Bootstrap library was used to create a responsive design and create the form, navbar, and card elements.

### Content 
- Writing up the README file;
    - I viewed the code institute [sample readme](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/StudentExampleProjectGradeFive). 
    - I used the [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#code). 
    - I also got inspiration from other students within the slack channel for user-centric front-end development and peer reviews. 
- The content itself was either written by me or got from one of two pages, [CSO Online](https://www.csoonline.com/article/2117843/what-is-phishing-how-this-cyber-attack-works-and-how-to-prevent-it.html) is where I got the summary of what Phishing is and [The State Of Security](https://www.tripwire.com/state-of-security/security-awareness/6-common-phishing-attacks-and-how-to-protect-against-them/) is where I got the information on each type of Phishing. Both were used on the home page.

### Media 
- The main logo I purchased from Vector Stock and tweaked myself using photoshop [VectorStock](https://www.vectorstock.com/royalty-free-vector/thief-hacking-a-computer-icon-cyber-attack-vector-21584120?refer=eml).
- The blue cartoon fish I got from  [Web Stock Review](https://webstockreview.net/pict/getfirst) and again tweaked myself using photoshop to create the 6 different cards.

### Acknowledgements
- I have to thank WenDevSimplified and PortEXE in particular for making the tutorial very fun and easy to follow. Of course, the reason it was easy is due to the great content in the modules I have studied previously with The Code Institute. 
- Thank you to everyone who took their time to provide me constructive feedback on the Slack community page and of course my friends and family.
- Big thanks to my mentor for putting up with my many questions, giving me great insights, and going above and beyond their position to help me.
